Exercise 1

Exercise 2
Consider this fragment of code:
	1 import turtle
	2
	3 tess = turtle.Turtle()
	4 alex = tess
	5 alex.color("hotpink")

Does this fragment create one or two turtle instances? 
- This fragment create two turtles.

Does setting the color of alex also change the color of tess? 
- No, it doesn't

Explain in detail.
- alex is a duplicated version of tess. Color of alex will be changed after duplication. Therefore, the color of tess remains black but alex's turns into hotpink.
